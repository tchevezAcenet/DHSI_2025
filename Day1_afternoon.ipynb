    "# Introduction to Python for Digital Humanities\n",
    "The Digital Humanities (DH) is an interdisciplinary field that brings together computational tools and methods with traditional disciplines in the humanities, such as history, literature, art history, linguistics, philosophy, and cultural studies. As the volume of digital cultural content grows—such as digitized manuscripts, historical records, social media posts, and multimedia archives—the need to process, analyze, and interpret these materials using digital tools becomes increasingly important.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Python in the Digital Humanities?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has emerged as a key language in DH because it is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Easy to Read and Write:** Python’s clean syntax makes it approachable, especially for scholars without a computer science background.\n",
    "- **Widely Supported:** Python has a vibrant global community and extensive online documentation, tutorials, and forums.\n",
    "- **Rich in Libraries:** There are many ready-to-use libraries for working with text, data, images, sound, and even geographic information.\n",
    "- **Flexible and Powerful:** Python can be used for small tasks like file renaming, or large-scale tasks like building full text analysis pipelines or interactive web applications.\n",
    "- **Interoperable:** Python can work with many different file formats (e.g., CSV, XML, JSON, PDF, images) and integrate with other tools commonly used in humanities research.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Applications of Python in DH\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Python, digital humanists can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analyze Large Text Corpora:** Quickly process thousands of pages to extract keywords, count word frequencies, detect sentiment, or classify genres.\n",
    "- **Explore Historical Patterns:** Visualize trends over time using data from newspapers, census records, or personal letters.\n",
    "- **Build Digital Exhibits:** Combine historical images, audio clips, and data visualizations in an interactive website.\n",
    "- **Transcribe and Clean Data:** Automate OCR cleanup, remove metadata noise, or reformat archival information.\n",
    "- **Perform Network Analysis:** Study connections between people, places, or concepts across time using network graphs.\n",
    "- **Map Cultural Content:** Use Python’s geospatial libraries to create maps that show the spread of artistic movements, migration patterns, or historical events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text Mining:** Identify recurring phrases and topics in a century's worth of digitized books.\n",
    "- **Social Media Analysis:** Study public sentiment and discourse during key cultural or political events.\n",
    "- **Metadata Curation:** Automatically extract, clean, and organize metadata from thousands of image or document files.\n",
    "- **Historical Visualization:** Animate the rise and fall of empires using historical timelines and geographic data.\n",
    "- **Interactive Archives:** Create searchable digital editions of rare manuscripts using Python web frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "By learning Python, researchers in the humanities gain a set of tools to extend their traditional methods, handle complex datasets, and share their work in innovative and engaging ways."

    "## Introduction to JupyterLab\n",
    "JupyterLab is an interactive computing environment that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It is commonly used in data science, research, and education, especially for projects in the Digital Humanities, because of its flexibility and ease of use. JupyterLab is essentially an upgrade of Jupyter Notebooks, providing a more modular and feature-rich interface."

    "### Key Features of JupyterLab:\n",
    "- **Code cells:** These are cells where you write and execute code.\n",
    "- **Markdown cells:** These cells are used for explanatory text, formatted using Markdown.\n",
    "- **Rich outputs:** Visualizations, graphs, images, and other media can be displayed inline within the notebook.\n",
    "- **File management:** JupyterLab has a built-in file browser that allows you to organize and manage notebooks, text files, images, and other resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Add Cells in JupyterLab\n",
    "In JupyterLab, cells are the building blocks of your notebook. You can add, delete, and modify cells to create a flow between code execution and explanatory text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding Cells:\n",
    "1. **Via Menu:** Navigate to the top menu: *Insert → Insert Cell Below or Insert → Insert Cell Above.*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Keyboard Shortcuts:** *Press B* to insert a cell below the current one or *A* to insert a cell above.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Clicking Buttons:** Use the \"+\" button in the toolbar to insert new cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Switching Between Cell Types (Code and Markdown):\n",
    "You can switch between code cells and markdown cells to organize your content effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **To Change a Cell Type to Code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Select the cell and *press Y*.\n",
    "- Alternatively, click on the Cell Type dropdown menu in the toolbar (where \"Markdown\" is by default) and select Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **To Change a Cell Type to Markdown:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Select the cell and *press M*.\n",
    "- Alternatively, use the Cell Type dropdown and select Markdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to seamlessly switch between running code and writing descriptive text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running and Stopping Cells\n",
    "Cells in JupyterLab can either be run (executed) or stopped, depending on whether you want to see the result of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Running Cells:**\n",
    "To execute a cell, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Windows/Linux: Press *Shift + Enter* to run the current cell and move to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mac: Press *Shift + Enter* to run the current cell and move to the next. You can also use *command + Enter* to run the cell and stay in that cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Alternatively, click the *Run* button in the toolbar.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Stopping a Cell:**\n",
    "If you want to stop the execution of a cell:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Navigate to *Kernel → Interrupt* in the top menu or use the Stop button in the toolbar.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut *I* twice (press I quickly two times) to interrupt the current execution."

    "1. **Run code:** Shift + Enter\n",
    "2. **Interrupt kernel:** Stop a running cell (especially useful if stuck on [*])\n",
    "3. **Restart kernel:** Clears everything the kernel remembers (variables, imports, etc.)\n",
